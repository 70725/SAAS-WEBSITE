                Keeping ourselves safe on the internet is one of the best things that we could do, especially with the world coming
                into a very technological sense. In order to keep ourselves safe, a good idea of what we could do is making sure to 
                follow and just do the best practices against cyber-attacks, whenever we make an account or when we do something technological.
                In this way, we will be able to help ourselves to do better, and become safer throughout our technological journeys through
                life. However, the first step to success to learn about cyber-attacks is always understanding what we are really dealing with.

                What is a cyber-attack/cyber-threat?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Cyber threats and cyber-attacks refers to any possibility of an attempt of malicious intent. This can lead from a range of 
                viruses, ransomware, phishing, and data theft, which is likely the one that most people are afraid of. Although obvious, these
                can be deadly to individuals, and especially organisations who seem to have lots of employees and workers, therefore increasing
                the chances of a cyber-attack occurring. This is the reason why understanding how you can protect yourself from these are crucial.
