                    The website widely divided these into 3 separate parts, financial, reputational, and legal. The economic
                    cost of a cyber attack could be Theft of Corporate Information, Theft of Financial Information, Theft of
                    Money Disruption to Trading, and Loss of Business or Contract. For the reputational damage, this will be
                     a loss of customers, sales, and a reduction in profits/revenue. And lastly for legal consequences, if
                    the data is deliberately or accidentally compromised then there may be fines or regulatory sanctions. 
                    However, this source also gave a few ways that you can minimise the impact, which is using the free 
                    cyber action plan, which is a plan that lists the things that you/your company can do to protect 
                    against cyber-attacks. Other ways to minimise the impact include: Reporting the incident to the relevant
                    authority, cleaning up the affected systems, or getting it up and running again as soon as possible.

            <p>
                
                Keeping ourselves safe on the internet is one of the best things that we could do, especially with the world coming
                into a very technological sense. In order to keep ourselves safe, a good idea of what we could do is making sure to 
                follow and just do the best practices against cyber-attacks, whenever we make an account or when we do something technological.
                In this way, we will be able to help ourselves to do better, and become safer throughout our technological journeys through
                life. However, the first step to success to learn about cyber-attacks is always understanding what we are really dealing with.

                What is a cyber-attack/cyber-threat?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Cyber threats and cyber-attacks refers to any possibility of an attempt of malicious intent. This can lead from a range of 
                viruses, ransomware, phishing, and data theft, which is likely the one that most people are afraid of. Although obvious, these
                can be deadly to individuals, and especially organisations who seem to have lots of employees and workers, therefore increasing
                the chances of a cyber-attack occurring. This is the reason why understanding how you can protect yourself from these are crucial.

                <p>
                    Although it may seem obvious, we must protect our login details, our payment information, important documents we have, and much much more. 
                    This could even include and be simple things, such as your email address, or your phone number. Overall, the thing that we are trying to 
                    protect is what hackers and cyber-attacks are used for, which is gaining illegal and private data about you, your family, and your friends.
