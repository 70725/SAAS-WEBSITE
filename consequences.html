                    The website widely divided these into 3 separate parts, financial, reputational, and legal. The economic
                    cost of a cyber attack could be Theft of Corporate Information, Theft of Financial Information, Theft of
                    Money Disruption to Trading, and Loss of Business or Contract. For the reputational damage, this will be
                     a loss of customers, sales, and a reduction in profits/revenue. And lastly for legal consequences, if
                    the data is deliberately or accidentally compromised then there may be fines or regulatory sanctions. 
                    However, this source also gave a few ways that you can minimise the impact, which is using the free 
                    cyber action plan, which is a plan that lists the things that you/your company can do to protect 
                    against cyber-attacks. Other ways to minimise the impact include: Reporting the incident to the relevant
                    authority, cleaning up the affected systems, or getting it up and running again as soon as possible.

                Why is keeping ourselves safe from cyber-attacks a necessity?
            </h1>
            <p>
                
                Keeping ourselves safe on the internet is one of the best things that we could do, especially with the world coming
                into a very technological sense. In order to keep ourselves safe, a good idea of what we could do is making sure to 
                follow and just do the best practices against cyber-attacks, whenever we make an account or when we do something technological.
                In this way, we will be able to help ourselves to do better, and become safer throughout our technological journeys through
                life. However, the first step to success to learn about cyber-attacks is always understanding what we are really dealing with.

                What is the difference between a threat, a vulnerability, and a risk in Cybersecurity.
            </h1>
            <p>
                A threat follows any danger or harmful event that could take place and exploit vulnerabilities and impact security.
                A vulnerability are weaknesses and gaps in the security that can be exploited.
                A risk is a threat that capitalizes on a vulnerablity and the potential damage it could inflict.
                These three are important parts of the way that we can see that vulnerabilities and the consequences that these vulnerabilities could make
                on us. Thus, when we see a threat of anything, or we see any vulnerabilities in anywhere we look, we should try to be careful about what 
                and where we go, including what we press and the way that security may be able to help us. Without this, there will be many risks that
                follow, and therefore the consequences will resume.

                <p>
                    The exploitation of vulnerabilities technologically, authentication weaknesses, weak processes, flaws in the internet,
                    protocols without security, etc. We can see that there are many ways that cybernetic attacks occur, but this is only the 
                    case due to how people are securing themselves. With a good cybersecurity system as well as some knowledge about cyber attacks,
                    it will make it much easier for us to be able to prevent any of the previous exploitations, or at least help us to understand
                    what and why a cyber attack happened.
