                <p>
                    Emerging trends right now follow a total of 7 key steps, where were the following: Ransomware Evolution,
                     Supply Chain Vulnerabilities, Multi-Vector Attacks, Hybrid Data Centers, AI-Powered Cyberattacks, 
                     Threat Exposure Management, and Security Consolidation. These are the most recent emerging trends 
                     that have been occurring and this is only for now. As time moves and goes on, more trends will be
                     followed and we will have to ensure that our defence mechanisms continue to remain up to date.

                Why is keeping ourselves safe from cyber-attacks a necessity?
            </h1>
            <p>
                
                Keeping ourselves safe on the internet is one of the best things that we could do, especially with the world coming
                into a very technological sense. In order to keep ourselves safe, a good idea of what we could do is making sure to 
                follow and just do the best practices against cyber-attacks, whenever we make an account or when we do something technological.
                In this way, we will be able to help ourselves to do better, and become safer throughout our technological journeys through
                life. However, the first step to success to learn about cyber-attacks is always understanding what we are really dealing with.

                What are the negatives of the trends of our society at the moment?
            </h1>
            <p>
                The power of new Generative AI is able to help less proficicent actors be able to create more ransomware, therefore increasing
                the number of attacks that they can execute. This means that we can expect a larger majority of people to use AI for malicious
                purposes. Same goes for deepfaking, which is very cheap for the accuracy it provides. It uses AI in order to create a voice that
                can be used to mimic anyone's voice wit enough knowledge and examples. Another concern for our society leads from the way that 
                cybercriminals are able to use mobile devices with specific malware to steal logins or gain remote access to the device. Lastly,
                as technology keeps getting faster and higher, there will no longer be as many people with the cybersecurity skills to continue 
                to keep up and there will be a shortage of the amount of people who have the cybersecurity skills, compared to the amount of 
                people who need the help.

                <p>
                    Although new AI is being used for cyberattacks, they are also being used for training and practices as there is the integration
                    of AI and ML (Machine Learning). These are causing drastic changes in the way that we are able to locate threats and enable us
                    to analyzevast amounts of data in real time, therefore we are able to indentify any anomalies in the security breaches. This 
                    means that businesses will be able to enchance their threat capabilities and respond quickly to cyber threats. There has also 
                    been a shift to remote work, which has shown the importance of authentication and control mechanics when it comes to protecting
                    sensitive data and resources. This means that the implemntation of multi-factor authenication and strong password policies will
                    help mitigate the risks of theft and unauthorized access.
